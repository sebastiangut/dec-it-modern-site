# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide for DEC-IT Website

This guide will help you deploy the DEC-IT modern website to Netlify from GitHub.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account with the repository uploaded
- Netlify account (free tier available)
- Domain name (optional, Netlify provides free subdomain)

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Connect GitHub Repository to Netlify

1. **Login to Netlify**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up or login with your GitHub account

2. **Import Repository**
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
   - Authorize Netlify to access your repositories
   - Select `sebastiangut/dec-it-modern-site` repository

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings

Netlify should auto-detect the settings, but verify these configurations:

```
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: out
```

**Advanced Build Settings:**
- **Base directory:** (leave empty)
- **Functions directory:** functions (if using Netlify Functions later)

### Step 3: Environment Variables (Optional)

In Netlify dashboard, go to **Site settings > Environment variables** and add:

```
NODE_VERSION=18
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Step 4: Deploy

1. Click "Deploy site"
2. Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site
3. You'll get a random subdomain like `amazing-site-123456.netlify.app`

## 🌐 Custom Domain Setup

### Option 1: Netlify Subdomain
- Use the provided `.netlify.app` subdomain
- Free and works immediately

### Option 2: Custom Domain (dec-it.eu)

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Go to Site settings > Domain management
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter `dec-it.eu`

2. **DNS Configuration:**
   Add these records to your domain provider:

   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 75.2.60.5

   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
   ```
